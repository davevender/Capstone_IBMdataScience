Finding Insights Visually

Now with the dashboard completed, you should be able to use it to analyze SpaceX launch data, and answer the following questions:

1. Which site has the largest successful launches?
2. Which site has the highest launch success rate?
3. Which payload range(s) has the highest launch success rate?
4. Which payload range(s) has the lowest launch success rate?
5. Which F9 Booster version (v1.0, v1.1, FT, B4, B5, etc.) has the highest
    launch success rate?


1. KSC LC-39A (41.7%)
2. KSC LC-39A (76.6%)
3. Considering all sites, the payload range with the highest launch success rate should be between 3000 and 4000 kg (72.7%)
4. Considering all sites, the payload ranges with the lowest launch success rate are 500-1500, 4000-45000 and 5500-9000 (0%)
5. Considering all sites, the F9 booster with the highest success rate is B5. However B5 was launched only once so maybe it is not that representative... 
   Among the boosters that have been launched several times, the one with the highest success rate is FT (66.6%)
